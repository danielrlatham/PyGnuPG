Thanks for using PyGnuPG.
Basic help can be given with the '-h' flag.
More advanced help is given with '-h [other_flag]' to learn
 about a specific other flag.

Other flags:

-v, --version          : Prints version information to stdout
--text-mode            : Runs PyGnuPG in text-mode ignoring the GUI branch, also
                         recognized as a way to easily develop solutions to
                         complicated problems unrelated to GUI
